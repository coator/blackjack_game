# blackjack_game

What is this? 
It is a text based blackjack game from Udemy's lecture Complete Blackjack Course from Zero to Hero
https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/. I built this without help from the editior and it is one of my 
first projects using classes.

Does it work?
Not really. The game runs but it is very buggy

Why isn't there any older commits?
At some point I had to delete and reinitialize the .git repository because I was having trouble attempting to commit the git

Do you have any plans to finish it?
No.
